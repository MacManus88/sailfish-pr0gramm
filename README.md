# sailfish-pr0gramm
pr0gramm.com App for Sailfish OS

To-Do:
- support webm video files
- fix the viewing of the second page: "Weiter" and "Zurück" Buttons are always on the bottom (currently they aren't always visible), Image is shown between "Weiter" and "Zurück" Buttons and Tags
- fix "Weiter" button so that tags are correctly refreshed if a new image is shown
- bring comments to a correct view (so that each comment is under the comment, it belongs to)
- fix the full image view on second page(move zoomed image correctly etc)
- share Image (on WhatsApp (WhatsUp/Mitakuuluu), E-Mail...) - should be implemented in second page via pull down
- view benis (score) on second page and on comment page
